The Virtual Viewing Dome is an immersive 3D visualization environment for architectural design. 
It is an interactive room with a 360 degree display capable of accurately rendering 3D environments and inserted models. 
Users can collaboratively edit and apply materials to objects from in-built libraries in real time to get a sense of how their 
design will look in the physical world directly from their worksite. They will also have the ability to move around in a 3D 
environment and view models from any angle. The product will allow designers to create enhanced immersive experiences for 
clients to participate in, not just to view.
